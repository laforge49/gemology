**Session Date**: February 23, 2025
**Topic**: Refining Knowledge Management for Gemology
**Key Points**:
- Scrapped the massive context tree ideaâ€”too chaotic, like herding cats on a unicycle.
- New approach: top-level split by topic/project (e.g., gemology/pdml), each with a "sessions" directory.
- One session = one topic = one condensed file. Keeps it lean and GitHub-friendly.
- Aim: minimal working set per problem, preserving prior insights without redundancy.
- Next step: update top_context.txt and test the structure.

**Action**: Updated top_context.txt to reflect this shift.
**Open Q**: How to best condense sessions without losing critical insights?
