Topic: Documenting PDML (Persistent Data Markup Language) for the Gemology project (https://github.com/laforge49/gemology).

Format: Markdown (.md), GitHub-compatible.

Project Overview:

Gemology: Alternative object-oriented system with metadata.
PDML: Persistence markup language, maps to Python data structures. Subdirectory: https://github.com/laforge49/gemology/tree/main/pdml.
Goal: Create standalone PDML docs, no viewer references.
Documentation Progress:

Structure Defined:
Indentation for hierarchy.
Keywords: list, dict, include.
Scalars: Numbers, booleans, strings (", not '; \n, \" escapes); None unconfirmed.
Dict keys: Strings (e.g., "key":).
Multi-line Strings:
Single-line with \n (e.g., "a\nb").
Spanning lines (e.g., "a\nb" as "\na\nb"), no leading whitespace unless intended.
Includes: Separate syntax: include\n "file.pdml".
Examples: Sourced from https://github.com/laforge49/gemology/tree/main/pdml/test%20data (e.g., one.pdml, m003.pdml, m005.pdml). Errors from bad1.pdml.
Latest Draft: Lists, dicts, multi-line strings, includes, and errors covered. Reviewed for accuracy.
Discussion:

User corrected syntax errors (e.g., no list items), clarified include and string rules.
Focus: Keep examples pure PDML, avoid confusion with descriptive labels.
Next Steps:

User to confirm latest draft or request tweaks (e.g., more examples, None clarification).
