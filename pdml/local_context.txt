# pdml/local_context.txt
# Last Updated: 2025-02-23
# Purpose: Deep context for working within pdml subdir (https://github.com/laforge49/gemology/tree/main/pdml).
# Role: Core persistence layer via PDML markup, maps to Python data structures.

# Key Concepts
- Syntax: Indentation-based hierarchy.
  - Keywords: list, dict, include.
  - Scalars: Numbers, booleans, strings ("-delimited, \n, \" escapes).
  - Dict keys: Strings ("key":).
  - Comments: # terminates line (e.g., 42 # foo).
  - Non-persisted keys: #key: (excluded, supports objects/cycles).
  - Multi-line strings: "line1\nline2" or spans lines (no unintended leading whitespace).
  - Includes: include\n "file.pdml".
- Files: Parsed into Python objects (lists, dicts, etc.) for downstream use (gems, viewer).
- API: Loads PDML files (e.g., viewer.pdml in gems_viewer).

# Key Files
- PDML_overview.md: Full syntax spec and examples (https://github.com/laforge49/gemology/blob/main/pdml/PDML_overview.md).
  - Include when: Working on PDML parsing, validation, or file loading.

# Notes
- Errors: Single quotes (') unsupportedâ€”enforce double quotes.
- Test data: See pdml/test data/ (e.g., one.pdml, m005.pdml) for practical examples.
