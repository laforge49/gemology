# pdml/local_context.txt
# Last Updated: 2025-02-23
# Purpose: Deep context for working within pdml subdir (https://github.com/laforge49/gemology/tree/main/pdml).
# Role: Core persistence layer via PDML markup, maps to Python data structures.

# Key Concepts
- Syntax: Indentation-based hierarchy.
  - Keywords: list, dict, include.
  - Scalars: Numbers, booleans, strings ("-delimited, \n, \" escapes).
  - Dict keys: Strings ("key":).
  - Comments: # terminates line (e.g., 42 # foo).
  - Non-persisted keys: #key: (excluded, supports objects/cyclic refs).
  - Multi-line strings: "line1\nline2" or spans lines (no unintended leading whitespace).
  - Includes: include\n "file.pdml".
- API: Parses PDML into Python objects (lists, dicts) for gems, tkgems, gems_viewer.

# Hooks
- PDML_overview.md: Detailed syntax and examples (https://github.com/laforge49/gemology/blob/main/pdml/PDML_overview.md).
  - Include when: Task involves PDML syntax details, parsing logic, or test data validation.

# Notes
- Errors: Single quotes (') unsupported—use double quotes.
- Test data: pdml/test data/ (e.g., one.pdml, m005.pdml) for examples.
Changes
Hook: Explicit under “Hooks” with a clear “when to include” rule.
