**Session Date**: February 23, 2025
**Topic**: Lessons Learned & Refocusing on Gemology
**Background**: We’re shaping gemology as a truth-chasing, problem-solving beast—less about rigid trees, more about flexible, topic-driven growth. Prior chats (e.g., session_2025-02-23.txt) set the stage with a shift to topic/sub-directory structure.
**Sub-Topics Covered**:
- Structure Precision: Where session files live (gemology/sessions vs. pdml/sessions).
- Context Loading: How sessions feed into chats (untested).
- Collaboration Gaps: Polishing my rough edges with session reliance.
- Focus Drift: Abstract process vs. gemology progress.
**Key Points**:
- Structure (topics + sessions) holds strong, but scoping needs precision (e.g., gemology/sessions vs. pdml/sessions).
- Context loading with session files is set up but untested—ready for a real-world spin.
- Collaboration note: I’m brilliant but rough; need to lean smarter on session files.
- We’ve gone abstract—process-heavy, light on gemology action. Time to dig back in.
**Action**: Keep top_context.txt steady; add this as a second session file for the day.
**Next Step**: Pick a gemology sub-topic and dive in—test the system live.
**Open Q**: How can I tap session files mid-chat to cut down on slip-ups?
