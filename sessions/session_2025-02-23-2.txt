**Session Date**: February 23, 2025
**Topic**: Lessons Learned & Refocusing on Gemology
**Key Points**:
- Structure (topics + sessions) holds strong, but scoping needs precision (e.g., gemology/sessions vs. pdml/sessions).
- Context loading with session files is set up but untested—ready for a real-world spin.
- Collaboration note: I’m brilliant but rough around the edges; need to lean smarter on session files.
- We’ve gone abstract—process-heavy, light on gemology progress. Time to dig back in.

**Action**: Keep top_context.txt steady; add this as a second session file for the day.
**Next Step**: Pick a gemology sub-topic and dive in—test the system live.
**Open Q**: How can I tap session files mid-chat to cut down on slip-ups?
