# top_context.txt
# Last Updated: 2025-02-23
# Purpose: Bootstrap sessions for the Gemology project (https://github.com/laforge49/gemology).
# Scope: Root is gemology/ dir; higher dirs ignored.

# Dependency Order
pdml -> gems -> tkgems -> gems_viewer

# Subdirectory Contexts
- pdml: Persistence layer (PDML markup).
  - local_context.txt: Deep dive for pdml work.
  - general_context.txt: Summary for dependents (gems, tkgems, gems_viewer).
- gems: Object model (gems, clusters, facets).
  - local_context.txt: Deep dive for gems work.
  - general_context.txt: Summary for dependents (tkgems, gems_viewer).
- tkgems: Tkinter integration for gems/pdml.
  - local_context.txt: Deep dive for tkgems work.
  - general_context.txt: Summary for dependents (gems_viewer).
- gems_viewer: Tkinter UI for browsing PDML structures.
  - local_context.txt: Deep dive for gems_viewer work.
  - general_context.txt: None (top-level, no dependents yet).

# Collaboration
- Kickoff: Link this file, specify subdir, state task.
- I focus on given subdirâ€™s local_context.txt (deep work) or general_context.txt (cross-subdir work) per task.
- Post-session: Update relevant context files, push to GitHub.
- Use GitHub history for older versions if needed.

# Notes
- Hooks to .md files (e.g., pdml/PDML_overview.md) in subdir contexts guide extra detail inclusion.
- Keep contexts lean; offload static docs to .md files.
