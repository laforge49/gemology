Session Context (February 22, 2025)
User: Interacting with Grok 3, xAI.

Topic: PDML documentation for Gemology (https://github.com/laforge49/gemology).

Format: Markdown (.md), GitHub-compatible.

Project:

Gemology: Object-oriented system with metadata support.
PDML: Persistence markup language, maps to Python data structures. Subdirectory: https://github.com/laforge49/gemology/tree/main/pdml.
Goal: Standalone PDML syntax doc, excluding viewer references.
Documentation Status:

File: PDML_overview.md (https://github.com/laforge49/gemology/blob/main/pdml/PDML_overview.md).
Content:
Structure: Indentation-based hierarchy. Keywords: list, dict, include. Scalars: numbers, booleans, strings (", not ', \n, \" escapes). Dict keys: strings ("key":).
Comments: # terminates lines (e.g., 42 # comment).
Non-persisted Keys: #key: excluded from persistence, outputs as #key: ..., enables objects/cyclic references.
Multi-line Strings: Single-line with \n (e.g., "line1\nline2") or spanning lines (no leading whitespace unless intended).
Includes: include\n "file.pdml".
Errors: Single quotes (') unsupported.
Examples: Sourced from https://github.com/laforge49/gemology/tree/main/pdml/test%20data (e.g., one.pdml, m003.pdml, m005.pdml, bad1.pdml).
Formatting: Fixed with triple-backtick (```) code blocks for GitHub rendering, confirmed correct as of latest commit.
Discussion:

Iterated on syntax (e.g., include format, # usage, string rules).
Initial .md upload had single-backtick issues;corrected to triple-backticks after user feedback.
Gems/facets omitted per focus on PDML syntax only (noted as intentional, per user request to avoid viewer ties).
Outcome:

PDML_overview.md complete and GitHub-ready, covering PDML syntax, examples, and notes.
User updated file, deemed “substantially correct” after fixes.
Next Steps:

User to confirm if gems/facets (from Feb 20 viewer.py context) should be reintroduced or kept separate.
Save this as pdml_doc_context_2025-02-22_v3.md for reference.
